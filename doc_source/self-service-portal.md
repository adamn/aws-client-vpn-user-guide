# Use the self\-service portal<a name="self-service-portal"></a>

Your Client VPN endpoint administrator can configure a self\-service portal for the Client VPN endpoint\. The self\-service portal is a web page that enables you to download the latest version of the AWS provided client and the latest version of the Client VPN endpoint configuration file\. For more information about configuring the self\-service portal, see [Client VPN endpoints](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/vpn/latest/clientvpn-admin/cvpn-working-endpoints.html) in the *AWS Client VPN Administrator Guide*\.

Before you begin, you must have the ID of the Client VPN endpoint\. Your Client VPN endpoint administrator can provide you with the ID, or can give you a self\-service portal URL that includes the ID\.

**To access the self\-service portal**

1. Go to the self\-service portal at [https://self\-service\.clientvpn\.amazonaws\.com/](https://self-service.clientvpn.amazonaws.com/), or use the URL that was provided to you by your administrator\.

1. If required, enter the ID of the Client VPN endpoint, for example, `cvpn-endpoint-0123456abcd123456`\. Choose **Next**\.

1. Enter your user name and password and choose **Sign In**\. This is the same user name and password that you use to connect to the Client VPN endpoint\.

1. In the self\-service portal, you can do the following:
   + Download the latest version of the client configuration file for the Client VPN endpoint\.
   + Download the latest version of the AWS provided client for your platform\.
